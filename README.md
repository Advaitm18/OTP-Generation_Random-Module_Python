# Password-Generation_Random-Module

The OTP generation project using the **Random Module** in Python and **Pywhatkit** offers several benefits. 
Firstly, the Random module allows for the generation of unique and unpredictable OTPs, ensuring the security of the system. Secondly, Pywhatkit provides a convenient way to send the generated OTPs to the desired recipients, such as through WhatsApp messages. This feature enhances the user experience by delivering the OTPs directly to the users' preferred communication platform. Overall, this project combines the power of the random module and Pywhatkit to create a reliable and efficient OTP generation system.
